First Problem: How to read input from Tetr.io and convert it to a usable tetris board in our local machine?
Possible Approaches:
> Somehow read web elements directly?
> Keep capturing the screen at every frame and use an algorithm to convert it to a usable representation?
> Use Tetrio api (Is there even one?)
> Turn on audio cues in settings at use sounds to determine next piece?

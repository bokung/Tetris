ASSUME INPUT WORKS CORRECTLY :)
We are given the board as a (ROW, COLUMN) np.ndarray of True and False.
True indicates that a block is there, False indicates an empty square.
Also given is a list of the next 5 pieces, e.g. ['s','z','j','l','o']
We also have a variable that keeps track of what the held piece is, e.g. HELD = 's'
